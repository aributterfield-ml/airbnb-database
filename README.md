Database design for Airbnb, including ER diagrams, 3NF normalization, SQL schema creation, and PL/SQL procedures to support core functionalities.
# Airbnb Database Design

This repository contains a comprehensive database design for Airbnb, created as part of a Master's program coursework in Database Design.

## Project Overview
This project explores the design and implementation of a database for Airbnb, focusing on:
- **Entities and Relationships**: Definition of entities like users, hosts, properties, and transactions, along with their relationships.
- **ER Diagram**: Enhanced Entity-Relationship diagrams to represent the database schema.
- **Normalization**: Step-by-step transformation of the database to Third Normal Form (3NF).
- **SQL Implementation**: Creation of tables, keys, and constraints using SQL.
- **PL/SQL Procedures and Triggers**: Implementation of stored procedures and triggers to handle core operations like purchases and reviews.

## Contents
- **PDF Report**: Detailed documentation of the database design process, including diagrams, SQL scripts, and normalization steps.
- **SQL Scripts**: Included in the report for table creation, procedures, and triggers.

## Key Highlights
- Database schema tailored to Airbnb's functionalities.
- Normalized relational model for data integrity and efficiency.
- Practical triggers and procedures for real-world applications, such as:
  - Updating host response rates.
  - Calculating review averages.

## Usage
- Refer to the [PDF report](./Airbnb_Database_Design.pdf) for a detailed breakdown of the design process and SQL scripts.
